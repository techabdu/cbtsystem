## How To Use This File

**For every new chat / agent session:**
1. Read this file first to understand what has been completed and what is next.
2. Only work on the **current phase** or the specific task the user requests.
3. After completing a task, update the checkbox `[ ]` → `[x]` and add the completion date.
4. If a task is partially done, note the progress inline (e.g., `[~] 3/5 migrations created`).
5. Reference the specific guide file for implementation details (e.g., `02_DATABASE_SCHEMA.md` for table schemas).

### Status Legend
- `[ ]` — Not started
- `[~]` — In progress / partially done
- `[x]` — Completed
- `[!]` — Blocked / needs attention

### Stage 2.3.5 — Auth & Enrollment Refactor ✅ COMPLETE
> **Detailed Plan:** `.agent/auth-enrollment-refactor-plan.md`
> **Scope:** Replace self-registration with activation flow + Student self-service course enrollment

**Key Decisions:**
- ❌ No self-registration — admin pre-creates users without passwords
- 🔑 Students & lecturers "activate" by entering matric/file number and creating a password
- 🔐 Login uses matric number (students) / file number (lecturers) — NOT email
- 🏫 Students & lecturers each belong to one department (`department_id` FK on users)
- 📚 Students self-enroll in courses from their department
- 📅 Enrollment window set by admin via `system_settings` (`enrollment_start_date`, `enrollment_end_date`)

**Sprint 1 — Database + Backend Auth: ✅ COMPLETE**
- [x] Migration: Add `department_id` FK to `users` table — 2026-02-13
- [x] Migration: Make `password` nullable on `users` table — 2026-02-13
- [x] Migration: Add `staff_id` composite index — 2026-02-13
- [x] User Model: Add `department_id` fillable, `department()` relationship, `is_activated` accessor, `notActivated`/`inDepartment` scopes — 2026-02-13
- [x] Delete: `RegisterController.php`, `RegisterRequest.php` — 2026-02-13
- [x] Create: `ActivateAccountController.php`, `ActivateAccountRequest.php` — 2026-02-13
- [x] Modify: `AuthService.php` — remove `register()`, add `activate()`, change `login()` to use identifier — 2026-02-13
- [x] Modify: `LoginRequest.php`, `LoginController.php` — `email` → `identifier` — 2026-02-13
- [x] Modify: `CreateUserRequest.php` — remove password, add `department_id` (required for student/lecturer) — 2026-02-13
- [x] Modify: `UserService::create()` — no password, add `department_id` — 2026-02-13
- [x] Modify: `UserResource.php` — add `department`, `is_activated` — 2026-02-13
- [x] Modify: `routes/api.php` — remove register, add activate — 2026-02-13
- [x] Modify: `AuthController@me` — load department relation — 2026-02-13
- [x] **API verification:** Admin create user (no password), activate, login by identifier, error cases — all tested — 2026-02-13
- [ ] Update existing tests (register tests need removal, activate + login tests need updating)

**Sprint 2 — Frontend Auth: ✅ COMPLETE**
- [x] Delete: Register page, RegisterForm — 2026-02-13
- [x] Create: Activate Account page (`app/(auth)/activate/page.tsx`) + `ActivateForm.tsx` — 2026-02-13
- [x] Modify: Login page — identifier field (matric/file/email), activate link — 2026-02-13
- [x] Modify: `lib/api/auth.ts` — replaced `register()` with `activateAccount()` — 2026-02-13
- [x] Modify: `lib/types/api.ts` — `LoginCredentials.identifier`, `ActivateAccountData`, removed pwd from `CreateUserData` — 2026-02-13
- [x] Modify: `lib/types/models.ts` — added `department_id`, `department`, `is_activated` to User — 2026-02-13
- [x] Modify: `lib/store/authStore.ts` — replaced `register()` with `activateAccount()` — 2026-02-13
- [x] Modify: Admin Create User page — removed password fields, added department dropdown, info banner — 2026-02-13
- [x] Modify: `middleware.ts` — replaced `/register` with `/activate` in public routes — 2026-02-13
- [x] Modify: `constants.ts` — REGISTER → ACTIVATE — 2026-02-13
- [x] Modify: `app/page.tsx` — register links → activate links — 2026-02-13
- [x] **Build verification: 0 TypeScript errors** ✅ — 2026-02-13

**Sprint 3 — Combination Management:** ✅ COMPLETE
> NCE two-subject combination system: each student studies two departments (first + second major).
> Some specialized fields use "Double Major" (single dept studied in depth).
> Lecturers remain single-department. Admins have no department.

**Sprint 3a — Database + Backend:**
- [x] Migration: Create `combinations` table (`id`, `code`, `name`, `first_department_id` FK, `second_department_id` FK, `is_double_major` boolean, `is_active`, timestamps, soft deletes)
- [x] Migration: Add `combination_id` FK to `users` table (nullable, for students)

- [x] Service: Create `CombinationService` (CRUD, list with filters)
- [x] Controller: Create `CombinationController` (index, store, show, update, destroy, restore)
- [x] Requests: `CreateCombinationRequest`, `UpdateCombinationRequest`
- [x] Resource: `CombinationResource` (includes nested departments)
- [x] Routes: CRUD under `/api/v1/combinations` (admin only) + `GET /api/v1/combinations/active` (public)
- [x] Seeder: Seed sample combinations (CS/MTH, ENG/HIS, BIO/CHM, PHE double-major, etc.)
- [x] Update `CreateUserRequest` — students require `combination_id` (not `department_id`)
- [x] Update `UserService::create()` — set `combination_id` for students
- [x] Update `UserResource` — include `combination` with nested departments
- [x] API verification

**Sprint 3b — Frontend:**

- [ ] Frontend built and deployed (PM2 process manager)
- [ ] Queue workers configured (Supervisor)
- [ ] Database migrated and seeded with production data
- [ ] Redis configured for production
- [ ] Monitoring setup (uptime, performance, error tracking)
- [ ] Automated backups configured (daily full, 6-hour incremental)
- [ ] DNS configured

### Stage 9.2 — Go-Live Checklist
- [ ] All data migrated
- [ ] SSL working and verified
- [ ] Backups configured and tested
- [ ] Monitoring active (alerts configured)
- [ ] Support team trained and ready
- [ ] Rollback plan documented and tested
- [ ] Smoke tests passed on production
- [ ] Communication sent to users (launch announcement)

---

## PHASE 10: Post-Launch Support (Ongoing)
> **Goal:** Monitoring, bug fixes, iterative improvements

### Ongoing Tasks
- [ ] Monitor system uptime and performance daily
- [ ] Track and resolve bug reports
- [ ] Collect user feedback
- [ ] Plan and implement feature enhancements
- [ ] Regular security audits
- [ ] Database maintenance (cleanup old snapshots, archive logs)
- [ ] Performance tuning based on real usage patterns

### Success Metrics to Track
| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Online Platform Uptime | 99.5%+ |
| Exam System Uptime (during exams) | 99.9%+ |
| API Response Time (95th percentile) | < 200ms |
| Answer Auto-save Latency | < 1 second |
| Page Load Time (LCP) | < 2 seconds |
| Data Recovery (max data loss) | < 5 seconds |
| Concurrent Exam Sessions | 5,000+ |
| Exam Completion Rate | > 98% |
